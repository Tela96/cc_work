Important Disclaimer: I have set this mod up so that it is completely dependent upon the base Plantoid DLC files in order to function, so even tried to make it work without requiring Plantoids, it cannot function without it anyway. If you wish to use this mod, please pay for and download the Plantoids DLC if you wish to use it, as that is how it should be setup and I have set it up in accordance with law. Without Plantoids DLC files the mod cannot function and can crash your game. DO NOT subscribe to this mod without it. 

While it's technically not a required mod, it is very highly recommended that you use Antharis' Stellar Trails Disabler mod in conjuction with this mod. The Disabler mod removes the blue "streak" behind ships whenever they move. This looks particularly strange behind all but the blue-based Dark Plantoid variations, and thus the need for the mod.
